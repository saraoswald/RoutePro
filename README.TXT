1) Unzip all files
2) Cd to RoutePro directory containing Podfile and run pod install to install all dependencies.
3) Open RoutePro workspace file in xcode and hit run.
4) In simulator go into Debug-->Location-->Custom Location and input coordinates.
   Alternatively, look at xcode console and find arrow pointing towards top right (arrow should appear to the left of RoutePro name and logo).
   Click on arrow and select one of the preset location options. We highly recommend New York, NY, USA.
5) Contact sp3018@nyu.edu for any issues running program. If issues arise, we can supply our entire project including the (very large) pods.
